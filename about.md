# About Page 
I wear (a few too) many hats:
*   [Musician](https://soundcloud.com/b1-marrow "My Soundcloud")
    - Electronic and instrumental music ranging from relaxed to paniced.
*   [Teacher](https://nspu.ru/content/news/index.php?ELEMENT_ID=241278)
    - A Russian article written about my time teaching at Novosibirsk State Pedagogical University.
*   [Amateur Linguist - Southern Kannada](pdf/kannada.pdf)
    - A phonetic description of Kannada, a language of Southern India centered in Bangalore.
*   [Shakespeare Fan](https://www.reed.edu/reed_magazine/december2016/articles/apocrypha/traditions_myths_and_legends.html "Humor")
    - A Shakespearean story about the island once informally a part of Reed College.
Right now, I'm focused on integrating computer literacy with my background in writing and research, the result of which is this site.
